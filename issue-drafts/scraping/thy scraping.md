# TODO: canberk - describe the issue

Please refer to [Scraping Guide](https://github.com/FCanberk/coflight-prep/blob/master/guides/scraping%20guide.md) first to see the technologies used and the input / output formats.

Every 5 minutes [Turkish Airlines](http://www.turkishairlines.com/tr-tr/) website will be visited and every flight listed [here](FlightListLink) will be scraped. The output will be sent to orchestrator.

A valid citizenship id number and a valid credit card number will be needed for scrapping. Citizenship id numbers could be generated [here](https://www.simlict.com/tcno.html) and credit card numbers could be generated [here](https://names.igopaygo.com/credit-card).

These are the steps should be followed during one scraping session:
