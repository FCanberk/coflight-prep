## Coflight 

### Description

Coflight is about inspecting pricing policies (strategies) of airline companies and proving the rumors are right or wrong on social media which says deleting cookies affects ticket prices.

In this project we will check plane ticket prices to see if there's any differences between deleting and not deleting cookies. 

<br>With the data we collect we will also be able to answer these questions
<br>When is the cheapest and the most expensive season to buy any plane ticket ?
<br>When is the cheapest and the most expensive price to buy a plane ticket according to time left before take off ?
